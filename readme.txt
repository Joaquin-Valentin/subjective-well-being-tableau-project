Tableau Project

This project consisted of conducting an analysis of Gallup's Happiness World Reports from 2015
to 2022, ultimately to create a dashboard in Tableau. The Happiness Score is a 
national average of the responses to the main life evaluation question asked in 
the Gallup World Poll (GWP), which uses the Cantril Ladder.

The Happiness Score is explained by the following factors:

GDP per capita adjusted for Purchasing power parity
Healthy Life Expectancy
Social support
Freedom to make life choices
Generosity
Corruption Perception of both governments and private businesses
Residual error
